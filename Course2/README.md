## Installing Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio

### 1. [Cognitive Class Labs](https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai/login)

Since this specialization is supported by IBM. They have their own platform in which several tools are integrated, the steps to follow are really simply:
1. Create an account
2. Choose Jupyter Notebook or RSTUDIO IDE from the main page or Workbench as they call it (see picture below):

### 2. Anaconda Navigator (This option was used to generate these examples)

Install [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (most of the people in Data Science prefer it due to the several tools that offer for this area)

**For Windows**
1. Select a Python version 3.6/2.7 
2. During installation add the path to your environment variables
3. Go to conda prompt and type the following command to test that Anaconda was installed successfully.
```
(base) C:\Users\Name_User> conda list
```
 This will display all the packages that were installed
 
 4. Open ANACONDA Navigator

 5. Install and Launch Jupyter Notebooks or RSTUDIO.
